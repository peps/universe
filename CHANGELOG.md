✨ WHAT’S NEW

🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v1.0.0: A Boundless Paradise

_May 6, 2025_

Hey Everyone,

The day is finally here. After 2,863 days of hard work (!!!), the Tari mainnet is LIVE. Thank you for believing in us. For your passion. Late night bug reports. And brilliant ideas for making Tari Universe even better. Tari exists because of you 💜🐢
The birth of a proof-of-work network is special. In the early days, the network needs time to stabilize and find its rhythm. We call this the “warm-up phase.”

Contributors and early supporters of the Tari network (like exchanges and infrastructure partners) expect the warm-up phase to last about 15 days. After that, the network will transition to a more stable state.
During the warm-up phase, some quirks are normal. You might see block time fluctuations, temporary disconnections, syncing delays, or even short-lived forks that require your node to reconnect to the main chain.
The warm-up phase is a great time to mine because rewards are highest per block. We hope the early days of the Tari network are rewarding for you.

Let the games begin. May the blocks be forever in your favor!
